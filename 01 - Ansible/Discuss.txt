Ansible Components
	- Control Node - The machine from which you run the Ansible CLI tools.
	- Managed Nodes - Also referred to as ‘hosts’, these are the target devices you aim to manage with Ansible..
	- Inventory (hosts file) - A list of managed nodes provided by one or more ‘inventory sources’. Your inventory can specify information specific to each node, like IP address. 
	- Playbooks (YAML file) - They contain Plays (which are the basic unit of Ansible execution). This is both an ‘execution concept’ and how we describe the files on which ansible-playbook operates.
	- Tasks - the instructions specified by the user (Cli config, installation process, etc,.)

Ansible YAML Config
	- Gather Facts - Facts detail a complete snapshot of the state of each host system, including hardware, network configuration, operating system, and software installed
	- Become - privilege escalation.
	- Ansible Network OS - Specifies the type of device ansible is connecting to.
